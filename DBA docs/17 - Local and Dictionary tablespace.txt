Dictionary Managed Tablespace 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Oracle 8i and prior versions used to have table spaces in dictionary managed mode.
- in dictionary managed tablespace the free blocks information is used to maintain in data dictionary cache.
- when ever oracle needs a free block it need to get the information from free list and 
with that information data will be inserted into blocks( which are existing in datafiles) 
the will continue until oracle does not request free block.
- the disadvantage of using dictionary managed tablespace is performence degradation because of more I/O



Local Managed tablespace 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- from 9i oracle introduced locally managed tablespace which maintains the free block information 
in datafile header(instead of DDC) in the form of bitmap blocks.
- the status of the blok(in bitmap block) is maintained in the form of 0(free blcok) and 1(used block)
- since the free block information is mainained in datafile header itself. 
it is not necessary to take information from DDC which will avoid I/O
