Example 1: Displaying Schema Objects By Type
The following query lists all of the objects owned by the user issuing the query:

SELECT OBJECT_NAME, OBJECT_TYPE 
    FROM USER_OBJECTS;
The following is the query output:

OBJECT_NAME                OBJECT_TYPE
-------------------------  -------------------
EMP_DEPT                   CLUSTER
EMP                        TABLE
DEPT                       TABLE
EMP_DEPT_INDEX             INDEX
PUBLIC_EMP                 SYNONYM
EMP_MGR                    VIEW
Example 2: Displaying Dependencies of Views and Synonyms
When you create a view or a synonym, the view or synonym is based on its underlying base object. The ALL_DEPENDENCIES, USER_DEPENDENCIES, and DBA_DEPENDENCIES data dictionary views can be used to reveal the dependencies for a view. The ALL_SYNONYMS, USER_SYNONYMS, and DBA_SYNONYMS data dictionary views can be used to list the base object of a synonym. For example, the following query lists the base objects for the synonyms created by user jward:

SELECT TABLE_OWNER, TABLE_NAME, SYNONYM_NAME
    FROM DBA_SYNONYMS
    WHERE OWNER = 'JWARD';
The following is the query output:

TABLE_OWNER             TABLE_NAME   SYNONYM_NAME
----------------------  -----------  -----------------
SCOTT                   DEPT         DEPT
SCOTT                   EMP          EMP
